# MapApp
The application with a map on the main screen has the following features:
- finds the device by geolocation;
- you can put markers on the map;
- on a separate screen, you can view and edit the list of markers, add a name and annotation to the marker;
- by clicking on an element from the list of markers, the map opens and is positioned at the address of the selected marker;
- the list of markers is stored in an external database.
- displays the icon of the car, as in the Ya.Go or CityMobil application;
- with a long tap on the map, select the starting and ending points of the route. Using the Directions API, a route is defined and the icon of the car moves from the source to the end point of the route.
- in the application menu, you can uncheck the Car move box, then after selecting the start and end points, instead of moving the car, the full route will be displayed on the map.
